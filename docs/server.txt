SERVER INFORMATION

========================
== TEST FUNCTIONALITY ==
========================
Start the server.

Two files, test-site.php & test-site.html, can be found in the /project/server directory (both use localhost).
Running the test-site.php creates a new room in the next open slot (10 slots currently) on the server.
Refresh the test-site.php multiple times to create more rooms until at least room with port 3002 is created.
You can see the room information JSON on this test-site.php page.

Run the test-site.html file to connect to the room on port 3002.  The first client to connect is the SS host.
Every new page opened will be the "controllers" (run new tabs, refreshing disconnects/reconnects).

====================
== SERVER BACKEND ==
====================
Client messages are directly sent/echoed to the SS host, so you can control how you want it formatted (JSON, etc.).
Client disconnects (tab close, etc.) send "[[close]]" to the SS host (text will change in the future).
Host disconnects broadcast to all controllers in room "[[close]]".
Connecting clients priorities:
	1. Host exists (no host connected yet or host disconnected)
	2. Open controller slot (if another controller disconnected)
	3. New controller slot created at end of array
